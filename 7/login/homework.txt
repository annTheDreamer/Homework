1. Create a React App
2. Create a login form using useState.
3. The Login form should have three fields. email, username, password. Remember to use the corresponding input types.
4. Prevent submit if the above input values are empty 
5. Once submitted, add an additional check that checks if username or password are below 6 characters and throws an alert if conditions are unmet.

BONUS
Add a toggle password button.
Add an email pattern validation that checks if the email is valid. (Hint: RegExp to the rescue...);
