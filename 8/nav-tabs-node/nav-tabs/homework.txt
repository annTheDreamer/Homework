Create a react app with the following routes:

/ - Home - Should have a hero section welcoming the user
/about - About - Should have a lorem ipsum paragraph inside.
/posts - Posts - Using the JSON placeholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts), make an HTTP call using useEffect and render all the posts in a grid format. Create one card for each post.
404 Handler

Remember to add in-app navigation.

BONUS

Instead of using the JSON placeholder, use one of your Node apps as the API.
